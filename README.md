# ProperTs_Android

This is the Repo for IPV/IPY Final Project in Full Saill University - BS in Mobile Development. I am working 
with another student to put this together, and this Android version will complement his iOS version. I will link 
to his repo here once we have an Alpha release.

This project is a mobile rental property app that will go through several revisions before it's marketable to the 
general public. We plan to have a simple, basic feature set working for our final submission. These will include a tenant 
view that will have access to manager messaging, a complaint system, and a maintenance request page. The maintenance view 
will have simple work orders with priority sorting and will have the ability to close work orders as completed. The last 
view is for the manager and will house the creation and archiving of tenants, maintenance request viewing and responding, 
as well as access to messaging all of the rental units, individual units, and responding to the complaints.

All information will be saved without allowing access to the staff or tenant from deleting anything. Once it's said and 
written in the app, it's there forever for various legal reseasons for both tenant and manager.
